# focus

### Summary 

The goal of focus is to bring back mindfullness and concentration back to our daily lives. With the ever increase in social media, news, and any other application that outputs constant notifications, we now more than ever need something to bring us back to the current moment.

The intial goal is simple. A chrome extension that helps you focus. First set a topic or range of topics that you plan to focus on. For example, a group of topics could be "mindfullness, meditation, yoga", focus then does some nlp analysis locally on your browser and outputs a number between 1 and 100. This is your focus number. You can also set a focus lower limit which once your focus number drops below the application starts taking some action, such as blocking pages that are not pertained to your topics or notifying you that you are steering off task at an increasing rate. 

Once this has been achieved, the next step is to develop a set of learning algorithms that learn how you concentrate and focus. Sometimes we need a social media break or a music break, but it is about mindfully taking such breaks rather than in an impulsive way catalyzed by your emotions.
